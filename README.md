To understand MySQL, you first need to understand the database and SQL.
By definition, a database is merely a structured collection of data.

The data relating to each other by nature, e.g., a product belonged to a product category and associated with multiple tags. Therefore, we use the term relational database.
In the relational database, we model data like products, categories, tags, etc., using tables. A table contains columns and rows. It is like a spreadsheet.

A table may relate to another table using a relationship, e.g., one-to-one and one-to-many relationships.

Because we deal with a significant amount of data, we need a way to define the databases, tables, etc., and process data more efficiently. Besides, we want to turn the data into information.And this is where SQL comes to play.

***SQL â€“ the language of the relational database***

***SQL stands for the structured query language.***

***SQL is the standardized language used to access the database***

SQL contains three parts:
- Data definition language includes statements that help you define the database and its objects, e.g., tables, views, triggers, stored procedures, etc.
- Data manipulation language contains statements that allow you to update and query data.
- Data control language allows you to grant the permissions to a user to access specific data in the database.
- MySQL is a database management system that allows you to manage relational databases. It is open source software backed by Oracle. It means you can use MySQL without paying a dime. Also, if you want, you can change its source code to suit your needs.
